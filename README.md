# LinkedIsh

LinkedIsh is something like a mix of LinkedIn and Upwork/Fiverr.

You can add your skills, projects, and experiences to your profile.

You can also add your services and beyond that you can team up with other people as a group, agency or a company and offer your services as a team.

You can also create a job post and hire people for your projects. You can bid on job posts and get hired.
